<b>REQUIREMENTS</b>
<br/><br/>
By the <a href="http://law.atlantia.sca.org/Policy.html#2.9">Herald's Policies</a> of the Kingdom of Atlantia, 
court reports must be turned in by the herald who conducted court within two weeks of the event.  The court report 
must be sent to the Crowns or Coronets who held court, with copies sent to the Clerk of Precedence, 
the Triton Principal Herald, the Clerk Signet, and the Backlog Deputy.
<br/><br/>
<b>Royal Court Reports</b> should be sent to <b>royalcourtreport AT atlantia.sca.org</b>, which will include all required recipients listed above.
<br/><br/>
<b>Baronial Court Reports</b> should be sent to <b>courtreport AT atlantia.sca.org</b>, which will include all required recipients listed above except for the Baronial Coronets.
<br/><br/>
All court reports filed with the Clerk of Precedence should include the following information:<br/>
- Presiding Crowns/Coronets<br/>
- Event Name<br/>
- Event Date<br/>
- Court Time (if multiple courts were held during the day, specify morning, afternoon, evening, etc.)<br/>
- Herald's Name
<br/><br/>
List each award in the order bestowed.  For each award given, include the following information:<br/>
- Award Name<br/>
- SCA Name of recipient<br/>
- Legal Name of recipient<br/>
- Whether or not an official scroll was given
<br/><br/>
<b>SUGGESTIONS</b>
<br/><br/>
"Full" court reports (those that include all the court business, not just the recordable awards) are welcome.  <br/>
- Number the items of business that are awards, each on a separate line, so that they can easily be found and entered in sequence.  <br/>
- If a Baronial Court was opened and conducted within a Royal Court, mention that Baronial Court occurred, in the appropriate order, among the awards listed. 
<br/><br/>
Send a second version of the court report, with legal names stripped, to both the Atlantian Heralds list and either the Merry Rose (for royal courts) or appropriate baronial e-list (for baronial courts).
Posting it publicly allows for error checking and correction when things are still fresh in the mind.
<br/><br/>
For baronial courts, send a copy of the full court report to the baronial herald if he/she was not the one to herald court.
<br/><br/>
Try to find the spelling of the SCA name of the recipient used in the OP and reference that (indicating changes in spelling/name registration, if known) in your court report.
